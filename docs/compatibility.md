# Compatibility

Skills SDK keeps portable contracts independent of Agent-Skills, Skills
Foundry, Codex, Tessl, and any local runtime filesystem. Host adapters and
providers consume the contracts through explicit boundaries; they are not
implicit dependencies of the core package.

## Runtime and dependency floor

- Python `>=3.12,<3.13`.
- Pydantic `>=2.11,<3` for typed contract models.
- JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 for packaged schemas.
- The repository's pinned `uv.lock` is the reproducible development toolchain.

## Contract policy

Every versioned Pydantic model carries a `schema_version` where the contract
defines one. Some low-level identity, source, owner, and receipt-base JSON
schemas intentionally accept the bare wire shape without that envelope field;
use the corresponding model dump when a versioned payload is required. Unknown
model fields are rejected, portable paths are validated at the boundary, and
candidate-bound evidence keeps source revision and content digest together. A
validation failure is an explicit blocker; there is no waiver or suppression
path.

Within the `0.1.x` line, compatible additions may add optional data without
changing the meaning of existing fields. Changing required fields, enum
values, semantic invariants, or schema meaning requires a new schema version,
updated fixtures, and a compatibility note. Tests and the generated schemas
are the executable compatibility proof.

## Separate evidence lanes

The SDK's local contract and schema checks do not prove provider execution,
runtime installation, Tessl publication, or installed behavior. Those lanes
must bind the same candidate identity and report their own evidence.
